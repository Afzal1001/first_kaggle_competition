🚀 Spaceship Titanic – Machine Learning Prediction

Welcome to the Spaceship Titanic repository!
This project uses machine learning to predict whether passengers were transported to an alternate dimension following the Spaceship Titanic accident.
The project is based on the official Kaggle Spaceship Titanic competition.

🚀 Project Overview

This repository contains a supervised machine learning classification model trained on passenger data to predict the Transported outcome (True or False).
The project focuses on:

* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Feature engineering
* Model training and evaluation
* Generating predictions for Kaggle submission

The goal is to maximize prediction accuracy on unseen test data.

📊 Data Sources
Kaggle Spaceship Titanic Dataset

train.csv: Passenger features with labels
test.csv: Passenger features without labels
sample_submission.csv

Key Features Used
* Passenger demographics (Age, HomePlanet, CryoSleep)
* Spending behavior (RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck)
* Travel details (Cabin, Destination, VIP)

🏁 How It Works

* Data Loading
* Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
* Model Training
